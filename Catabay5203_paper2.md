# Surveying The Inner-City: Income, Health, and Information Access
### Keno Catabay - Florida State University

## Abstract
The following research paper explores the relationship between the inner-city population and information access. I am interested in investigating a possible correlation between standard of living (income, health, and comfort) and information access. I will also provide a review of literature from various sources that have studied the inner-city population. I hypothesize that as the standard of living decreases, so does information access. However, it would be of best interest to information professionals to know how impoverished individuals tend to receive their information. Knowing how a variety of individuals within the inner-city population receives their information may be vital to improving the overall quality of life in these areas. My research proposal seeks to fill in these information gaps in the form of a questionnaire. 

## Introduction 
Telecommunications and information technology have been growing at a rapid rate, as competition and corporate alliances take the center stage in an arena that leaves government policy in constant flux (Krieg, 1995). Likewise, only passing thoughts have been given to the affect that growing technology may have in the renewal of urban communities (Krieg, 1995). According to Krieg (1995), deploying an information technology initiative within the inner-city would be extremely difficult as public and private-sector agencies may not possess the resources, skills, or motivation to enact such computer-based initiatives. 

For clarification’s sake, I will be using the term inner-city as defined by Gadsden (2017): “defined geographic areas within cities housing the poor, African Americans, Latinos, other ethnic minorities, immigrants, and historically marginalized groups, and to the re-creation of cultural practices that are associated with limited material resources” (p. 14).

## Literature Review
Ludwig (1999) found that teens living in high-poverty central city communities underestimate the occupational requirements for the jobs that they aspire to attain. Ludwig (1999) also found that teens from more affluent families had a better understanding of the labor market, as they likely had access to information sources that were provided to them by their parents, such as newspapers or books. Likewise, high-poverty areas have an increased high school dropout rate due to imperfect information of the labor market (Ludwig, 1995). The high dropout rate of these areas may be responsible for the development of urban drug scenes among youth. A longitudinal study on street-entrenched youth in Vancouver found that leaving the inner-city drug scene was a three-fold process: (a) securing legitimate employment; (b) physically and socially separating themselves from the drug scene; and (c) reducing drug consumption (Knight et al., 2017). Securing legitimate employment is often difficult for street-entrenched youth who have disbelief in a steady income job, due to a lack of understanding of the labor market (Knight et al., 2017). The departure of youth drug-use is vital to the overall health of the community, as previous research found that drug-entrenched youth (those under age 30) were more likely to have infectious (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C) and chronic (e.g., diabetes, liver disease) diseases (Jacka et al., 2016). Other research found that young people involved in drug scenes were also more at risk for socioeconomic deprivation, homelessness, addiction, and mental health issues (Fast et al., 2014). In the study by Knight et al. (2017), there were some opportunities that provided assistance for youth to find steady jobs, but many were either unaware of the service or did not trust the system set in place, preferring their own methods of leaving the scene. 

A major part of the inner-city youth’s awareness of reliable information sources stems from the school system. Anderson (2017) notes that it is possible that black, inner-city high school attendees view the school structure as an extension of white society, which gives black students an untrusting attitude towards educational institutions. The racial exclusion that inner-city students feel against white-dominated society may interfere with the overall mission of schooling (Anderson, 2017). Youth often fail to see the purpose of educational resources that schools provide due to few examples of individuals within their neighborhood that went to school and found success through its teachings (Anderson, 2017). Lastly, Anderson (2017) notes that the challenging circumstances that inner-city youth face has shifted the inner-city teacher into more of a social worker role, as students may be more likely to show up to class stressed, hungry, or even intoxicated—this results in a high faculty turnover rate which further deteriorates the school. If the inner-city schools are lacking in qualified teachers, it is not surprising that they are also lacking in qualified information professionals as well. One study follows an elementary school whose library was completely shut down due to financial constraints, and found that a new teacher who had a background in school libraries produced students that achieved higher levels of information/digital literacy compared to a veteran teacher who did not have such a background (Neuman, 2015). Neuman (2015) notes that the approach that the library-trained teacher took would be more useful if she could spread it to a wider array of students. Unfortunately, schools continue to cut faculty in school libraries in central-city communities—figures produced in 2013 indicate that of the 212 public schools located in Philadelphia, only 11 had libraries that were staffed by certified school librarians (McCorry, 2014).

Still, youth comprises only a portion of the inner-city population, and their information trends may not be representative of the whole. Individuals known as gatekeepers may be key to understanding how information in the inner-city functions. Kurtz (1968) defines gatekeepers as intermediaries who move between cultures, linking community members with alternatives and solutions. They tend to have high information potential, a larger awareness of information sources, and use more information resources than other members of their community (Dervin, 1976). Public libraries may find it in their best interest to establish relationships with gatekeepers to forward the dissemination of knowledge back into the community (Chatman and Pendleton, 1995). Studying gatekeepers may be helpful in studying information usage and literacy trends in inner-cities, as Agada (1999) did in the Milwaukee neighborhood named Harambee. The study followed 20 inner-city gatekeepers who have resided in the Harambee neighborhood for a mean duration of 25.4 years, and found that gatekeepers felt the lack of awareness of appropriate information sources stemmed from a perceived irrelevance to the community and a general distrust for the service (Agada, 1999). Agada (1999) claims that the highly personal needs of inner-city populations overlap with their information and resource needs. These highly personal needs tend to be oriented towards the short-term, making the population seek out coping information rather than information that will better their socioeconomic status (Nauratil, 1985). Snyder (1976) recommends that the relationship between gatekeepers and information services should be carefully used to bridge the information gap of the inner-city community. 

As discussed earlier, drug use has a positive correlation with increased infectious and chronic diseases in the inner-city (Jacka et al., 2016). Likewise, proper dissemination of health information is crucial to raising the standard of living within these neighborhoods. Reliable health information may be harder for the inner-city to acquaint itself with, as many do not even have access to the Internet—two studies found that there is a direct relationship between income and education and internet access (Brodie et al., 2000; Spooner et al., 2000). According to Humphreys (1998), there are many reasons that inhibit access to reliable health information, including a wide diversity of in the education and backgrounds of those seeking information, the distribution of information among many disciplines and information sources, a lack of awareness of information services, lack of access to Web-capable computers, and a lack of access to Internet connections. Sollenberger et al. (2003) claims that librarians can assist in providing appropriate health information through the Internet and by instructing individuals in inner-cities on how to locate and evaluate the information. 

Churches function as community centers for the inner-city population, and there is a long history of social action and outreach within these black churches (Baskin et al., 2003). There has been some moderate success in using these churches as avenues to disseminate health information, as demonstrated by the Congregation Healthy Heart Action Partnership coalition, which provided Internet access to 35 African-American churches in Rochester (Sollenberger et al., 2003). An inner-city community church in San Francisco was used in the planning and implementation of Web-based access to HIV/AIDS information resources, training 4 target groups to use information resources (Cashen et al., 2002). Although the program demonstrated promise, the inner-city patients (having little experience with computers) had difficulties in spelling words in search engines and the interpretation of health information (Cashen et al., 2002). Still, some researchers believe that community centers with appropriate technological infrastructures are an exceptional platform to teach those over the age of 65 (who are much less likely to use the internet than any other age group) on accessing health information (Kaufman and Rockoff, 2006; Fox 2005).

Quality of life as defined by the World Health Organization is defined as “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease” (WHO, 1997). Volume et al. (2001) notes that pharmacists have the responsibility to both dispense medicines and improve the health-related quality of life to their patients. Elderly people have increased cases of chronic diseases, therefore requiring more pharmaceutical services to discuss their medicine-related needs (Mangoni and Jackson, 2004). A 2016 study concluded that pharmacists, specifically community pharmacists, must develop to address immediate healthcare needs of their community (van Rensburg et al. 2017). Although the study focused on the elderly population in an urban community, the income of the population was high. More research must be conducted to address the elderly community and their health information needs within the inner-city, particularly the role of health information specialists and how they can increase overall health-related quality of life of their community.

## Research Questions

Based on my review of the literature relating to the inner-city population as a whole, I hypothesize that as the standard of living (health, income, comfort) decreases, both information access and information awareness decreases as well. I am also interested in developing a cursory understanding of how trustworthy the population finds information services as well. Literature supports a good understanding of the unique information needs of the inner-city population across all age groups, but lacks in producing concrete results on where or how the population prefers to access or retrieve their information. Based on these conclusions, I have produced the following research questions:

### RQ 1
Where/how do teens within an inner-city setting primarily receive their information?
### RQ 2
Where/how do adults within an inner-city setting primarily receive their information?
### RQ 3
Where/how do elderly people within an inner-city setting primarily receive their information?
### RQ 4
What factors may negatively influence a user's trust for an information service within an inner-city setting?

## Methods
To answer these questions, I suggest using a questionnaire that would be mailed to a variety of households in an urban community. The questionnaire will also include background information (income, gender, health, drug use, highest education) that is to be filled out by the user as well.

#### 1. When I don’t know something, I primarily look online to find the answer.
strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree.
#### 2. When I don’t know something, I primarily ask a friend, teacher, or colleague for the answer.
strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree.
#### 3. I have access to the internet:
never, sometimes, always.
#### 4. When I don’t know something, I primarily look through a book or other printed material for the answer.
 strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree.
#### 5. I use my local library as an information source:
never, sometimes, frequently
#### 6. I use my local church as an information source:
never, sometimes, frequently
#### 7. I am able to consult a doctor or health professional to discuss health issues.
strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree
#### 8. I live a comfortable life.
strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree
#### 9. I am able to provide for myself and/or my family.
strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree
#### 10. I trust my information sources.
strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree

## Data Analysis
The questionnaire must be brief and easy-to-understand as education levels in inner-cities suffer due to unfavorable circumstances (Lippman et al., 1996). Motivation to complete the questionnaire would need to be addressed. Besides a postcard, a compensation of a small amount of money will also be given to assist in a higher response rate. 

Most of the information that will be acquired will come from the first part of the questionnaire, which will ask the user to fill out their income, health, drug use, highest education, age, and gender. Issues in this area will be finding a way to get the survey to teens. A separate survey may need to be created to attain the appropriate and consensual information for how teens acquire their information. 

The survey’s responses are quantifiable and data visualizations of the results may be created to better understand the correlations between income, health, comfort, and information access. The data will reveal the income of the respondent and a basic understanding of how they gather their information. Based on this information, researchers may have a better understanding on how the standard of living affects information access in urban communities.  

## Impact
The data that will be gathered from my questionnaire are quantifiable and data visualizations of the results may be created to better understand the correlation between income/standard of living and information access. Because the data reveals the income, health conditions, and drug usage of the respondent, as well as how they primarily receive their information, researchers will have a better understanding on how the standard of living affects information access in urban communities. 

If there is a correlation between health and information access, then this study could potentially be used to encourage further research into health information science in urban communities. For example, if community members in this population have more accessibility to health information, then they may see a decline in STD cases, obesity, drug use, etc. If higher-educated individuals tend to have more knowledge of information sources, then more efforts could be made to assure that all community members know that there are sources available for them to use. The literature discussed that there is a sense of distrust towards standarized forms of information services. This study will further analyze this distrust and hopefully be used in future research to understand and conquer the distrust that has developed for high quality information in these communities.

Knowing how the general population is getting their information will be helpful to information specialists in the inner-city community. The study could serve as a catalyst for the education system to implement changes if teenagers are acquiring their information from less-than-ideal sources. It could also empower the local library or the local church to provide services that help spread awareness of alternative information sources, espcially in the area of health information, where literature has supported some degree of success already. This study may help budgeting in all of these settings as well, as information specialists will know where their efforts are to be best spent based on how users are acquiring information.

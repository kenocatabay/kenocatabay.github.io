# Surveying The Inner-City: Income, Health, and Information Access
## Keno Catabay // Florida State University

# Abstract
The following research paper explores the relationship between the inner-city population and information access. I am interested in investigating a possible correlation between standard of living (income, health, and comfort) and information access. I will also provide a review of literature from various sources that have studied the inner-city population. I hypothesize that as the standard of living decreases, so does information access. However, it would be of best interest to information professionals to know how impoverished individuals tend to receive their information. Knowing how a variety of individuals within the inner-city population receives their information may be vital to improving the overall quality of life in these areas. My research proposal seeks to fill in these information gaps in the form of a questionnaire.

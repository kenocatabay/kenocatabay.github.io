# Paper 1: Analyzing My Information Behavior by Keno Catabay
## 1. Introducing my Information Behavior
  Buck is about one years old, and I adopted him from my local shelter. Right off the bat, I knew that Buck would not be like Montana, my super lazy labrador mix. I brought Buck home, and he was excited, yet defiant, and he did want to back down from Montana’s indications of dominance. I obviously did some cursory research before getting another dog (but not more than a Google search, honestly), and had to have my two dogs separated for the first few nights. I knew that if I wanted to maintain peace in my home, I had to reach out to an expert. Not unlike setting up a meeting with a subject librarian, I decided to sign me and Buck up for a six-week obedience training class.
## 2. Information 
Information can be a tricky thing to define. Case describes it as "any difference you perceive, in your enviornment or within yourself. It is any aspect or pattern that you notice in your reality. It is something that brings about a change in your take on the world" (6). One of the first things a reasonable dog owner recognizes is that human perceptions of information does not match up to the information perceptions of their pooch. It is simply biological. It is unfortunate that millions of companion animals are put to sleep each year because their owners thought they would operate like humans. You simply cannot tell your dog to not chew your shoes or to “sit/stay” like you could to another human being on the first try. Never mind a language barrier; a dog does not speak human language to begin with. To train a dog, you have to take a step back and imagine yourself as a canine, attempting to process the information through the perspective of your furry friend. And if you get frustrated, the dog usually does not even know why! When thinking about information, I not only considered my perception of it, but also how Buck perceives information.

I joined this obedience class with my dog, Buck, to take a more active approach in training him. I think when dealing with something as delicate as a life itself, it is important to seek out help from trained professionals that can work with you one-on-one. I feel as if the communication barrier between me and my two dogs has reduced drastically, and I am less uncertain of their behaviors and more aware of what they need from me. That being said, this class was not really about training Buck--it was a way for me to acquire the information I needed to train him myself. I think we learn better when we try things on our own two feet—when we collaborate with others
## Information Needs
I trained my older dog, Montana, when I was an undergrad all by myself, and basically all of the information I acquired back then was from the internet (Google, YouTube). Although I am an advocate for digital literacy and learning in virtual environments, I have to say that nothing can truly beat working with a dog trainer one-on-one. I argue that when dealing with a living animal, it is better to interact with an expert face-to-face. Although I am being taught to recognize patterns in a canines behavior, every rescue dog carries some sort of idiosyncrasy over from their past. It is humbling to put the advice of an expert—someone who trains these animals for a living—in front of my own speculations and Google searches. There appears to be a certain virtue in face-to-face interactions versus virtual ones. Perhaps, in the same way that people like the physical feeling of a book, that the experience of receiving instruction from an expert is preferable over virtual interaction. 

I think the concept of information as uncertainty reduction drove me to attending this training course (Case, pg. 84-85). There is a certain anxiety that comes with receiving information that also requires skill to execute. Sports comes to mind. There are elaborate movements involved in Olympic weightlifting, and there are countless texts and videos that can offer one instruction on how to properly perform a clean, jerk, and snatch. However, no matter how much a person practices on their own, it is almost always ideal for them to join a club with a coach. There is an appeal in being around others who can offer guidance and expert testimony. Being around an expert not only reduces uncertainty, but it also reduces unwanted anxiety that comes from the possibility of injuring oneself. If a person is performing a weightlifting movement incorrectly with an expert around, they can simply be corrected on the spot. This same concept can be carried over to my dog training course. There are times when I feel uncertain about my techniques when training Buck, but when the trainer watches me interact with my dog, they can immediately offer me a unique critique of my execution. Thus, I would like to offer a correction to my original information need: I not only needed the knowledge of how to train a dog, but I also needed assistance and troubleshooting on how to execute the concepts I learned.

## Information Seeking
It is strange how I even came to the conclusion to attend the class in the first place. Johnson and Wilson suggest that information behaviors are sometimes passive and serendipitous encounters (1997). They state that information-seeking behaviors include these face-to-face interactions, as well as passive sources like TV channels or browsing through the internet. I only signed up for the class and deemed it as something I “needed” after I saw it on a flyer by the shelter I adopted Buck at. There are countless times when I receive information without any intention of acting upon it. We are handed flyers and have advertisements practically thrown at our faces at every corner. It seems undeniable that we only pick and choose which information is the most useful to us, Wilson uses the phrase, “purposive acquisition of information” to describe this behavior (1997, pg. 26). Had I not recently adopted a new dog, I would have probably received the information about classes and forgotten about it. However, since I adopted Buck, the advertisement became suddenly relevant to me.

## Information Behavior
As I have previously stated, most of my previous experience with dog training came from cursory Google searches, YouTube videos, and the occasional friend giving me advice. I am still not entirely sure that I was ready to make room for a new dog in my life. Running into Buck also happened to be a serendipitous behavior. I was only at the shelter because my roommate and his girlfriend wanted to look at dogs for fun. I went in there just to look at the rescue animals, but I fell in love with Buck the moment I saw him in his cage. He was in the last dog, in the last room, and I just froze up--I do not really know why. Information is such an enigmatic concept--somewhat akin to the immediate infatuation I felt with Buck. I knew I had to rescue him. He was mine the moment I saw him. He was mine, even when the coordinator told me he would be a handful. Case claims that information brings about change, and that is exactly what Buck did to me (6). Buck flipped my world upside down, and that incited a call-to-action. I had to do everything in my power to make sure this dog and I could live harmoniously. 

Pinpointing my information behavior with Buck is very difficult for me, as adopting him was largely a decision based on intuition, and consequently, me attempting to fill in the gaps of knowledge on a whim. All I knew is that I wanted to help the poor guy. If I could describe my information in one, platitudious phrase it would be: "Help me, help him." From there, I let the pieces fall into place. I signed him up for the class because it was a hung up on a flyer in the shelter. Upon further refleciton, I can see that I engaged in purposive behaviors that do not involve information seeking--I would not let anyone let me reconsider adopting him, I did not let my roommate talk me about of it--logic came second to my intense desire to save the guy. 

#### A Meta-Perspective in my Information Behavior
If I took a step back, my initial behavior was not actually trying to acquire knowledge on how to train Buck well. The exigence I was attempting to solve was this intense desire to save this dog, who had been homeless for months. The first problem I actually encountered was: How do I save this dog? The immediate answer was simple: Adopt him, and worry about the repercussions later. Me spending extra time with him in a class was simply another piece of the puzzle on how to save him. The class tightened our bond. The class made us love each other more. Spending more time with Buck let him know that I was there for him. It let him know that I would never abandon him. The preservation of an enigmatic human-canine bond, I believe, truly is the core of my information behavior. 

# 3. Using the Foster Model to Analyze my Information Behavior

## Opening
Foster describes Opening as “information-seeking activities focused on solving information problems and is composed of chaining, monitoring, eclecticism, keyword searching, networking, serendipity, browsing and breadth of exploration” (Foster 2012). I believe that my information behavior was largely influenced by the latter concept, breadth of exploration. Breadth exploration was defined as a process where the information seeker consciously widens the scope of their information seeking (Foster, 2004). Having already done extensive research about dog training online, I was open to finding new perspectives in training my new canine. A little bit of serendipity was involved when I decided to enroll Buck into the obedience class, as I stumbled upon the class through a flyer that was handed to me at the shelter. I did not know that that was how I would attempt to solve my information need, but it ended up being an integral part of my information behavior.
## Orientation
Case glosses over Orientation briefly, noting that it consists of “reviewing, problem definition, and source identification” (164). Foster goes into deeper definition by describing orientation as the concept that “focuses on identification of questions and directions to look and is composed of identifying keywords, picture building, defining a problem, and source identifying and source selection decisions” (2003, 2004). I should reiterate that the Foster model emphasizes a non-linear approach to information seeking behavior, and it is safe to say that I believe my IB began with orientation. I knew what my information need was—I identified my problem as me not having enough confidence and know-how in training my new, high-energy dog. 
## Consolidation
Foster defines the third core process, Consolidation, as “a process of judging, integrating, and deciding whether further information seeking was necessary was confirmed across the original, and new data sets” (2012). I think this is a very interesting core process, as new information directly challenges old information. I went through this process of iterating through my information--as if it were a loop—sifting and refining the information and taking pauses through my reception of information. For example, I had previously used clicker training to associate good behavior with offering my dogs a treat. In one of my first classes, I learned that while there was an emphasis in positive reinforcement, the class would also integrate a negative “check” noise when the dog did not behave in the desired fashion. 
## Cognitive Approach
We did not use clickers in class, but yet, I still found it a useful tool to use. Rather than take every word from the class as gospel, I decided to take the parts I found effective and integrate them into my previous training regimen. This is Foster’s Cognitive Approach. I made the conscious effort to take what I wanted from the class and integrate that into my information-seeking behavior—Case briefly describes this as one encompassing “flexible, adaptable, ‘open and opening,’ nomadic thought and holistic approaches” (164). 
## Internal Context
Internal context are the “factors unique to each information seekers own profile” (Foster, 2004). In his later iteration of his model in 2012, Foster notes that motivation is a large factor that shapes internal context and one’s ability and willingness to take in new information. I was highly motivated to train my new dog, because I wanted us to not only have a deeper bond, but also for him to not adopt destructive behaviors. For me, it seems like this portion of the model plays a bigger factor than is emphasized in the texts. As I noted earlier, there are unique, inexcplicable reasons as to why I even adopted Buck in the first place. It was a gut feeling. I wish that there was a model that explained this strange fight-or-flight-like behavior. 
## External Context
“Extrinsic context as an element of the model emphasizes that an information seeker is not isolated from the multiple factors surrounding their information seeking” (Foster, 2012). There are some things that will always be outside of an information-seekers control. For example, the class had to reschedule one week due to Hurricane Irma. I noticed that after that event, some classmates did not return to the class…other constraints prevented them from pursuing information. I myself missed a week of class due to the hurricane as I left town and decided that staying for the class was less important than taking a mini vacation with my lovely pup in Tennessee. 

# 4. Compare and Contrast

### How did the model and the theory or paradigm affect your interpretation of your information behavior?
Using the Foster model definitely made me think about my information behavior on a technical level. I particularly enjoyed the non-linear emphasis of the model. I think that the non-linear approach is perhaps the most accurate approach to a real-life interpretation of information. The non-linear approaches recognizes that we, as humans, have options in our information seeking behaviors and needs, as well as how we address them. Encompassing those behaviors further are these overaching desires that we feel (intrinsic), as well as factors that we cannot control (extrinsic). I think that the Foster model is a good starting point to evaluating information needs and behaviors. 
### In what ways were the model and the paradigm or theory useful for explaining your information behavior?
As stated previously, the Foster model allowed me to think about my information behavior on a technical level. However, it was not until I started a deep reflection that I realized what the core of my information behavior was: An inexplicable desire to rescue a dog in need. In many ways, writing about my information behavior was more useful to me than compartmentalizing every point of my information behavior. Writing about how I came to the conclusion of even signing up for Buck and I to take these classes has deepened my understanding for adopting him. In many ways, I still do not understand why it all happened. In many ways, I am torn...

## A Final Word for Dr. Kazmer
Thank you for reading my paper, Dr. Kazmer. I am deeply saddened to tell you that three days ago, Buck jumped out of my car window on a busy street on the way home from the dog park. He was hit by a car, and a kind stranger helped me rushed him to the ER. The vet said he was dead on arrival. I cried and cried and I am still mourning the loss of one of my best friends. I can try to model my desire to save him from a life of homelessness forever, but it is so painful to keep writing about him. There are things that cannot be completely explained by theories or models...and that is how I am viewing my information behavior in the life and death of Buck. I do not, for one second, regret any moment I spent with Buck. He was a wild boy, but I know he loved me with all of his heart. I loved him too. Every night, he curled up to my neck, and fell asleep, with his sister at the foot of my bed. There is now this "gap of knowledge" that Buck once filled. I can iterate through every model and theory on how to occupy that space, but it is all to no avail. I cannot explain why I adopted Buck. I cannot explain why he left me so quickly. All I can do is celebrate the time we had together. Thank you.
